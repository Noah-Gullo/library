## Description:
The eighth project of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/about) and the first project of the "JavaScript" course. An application that allows you to track and manage the books that you are reading. 

## Skills:
This project tested my ability to create and manage JavaScript objects through a rudimentary backend decoupled with the DOM. This tested my knowledge of objects and constructors in JavaScript along with my prior HTML/CSS skills.

## Reflection:
This project was a good refresher into JavaScript and allowed me the opportunity to practice creating, deleting, and managing objects through constructors in JavaScript. It took me a bit longer than I anticipated, but every project I do gets a bit more polished than the last. I'm happy with where the project is now.
